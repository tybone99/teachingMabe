Overarching goal:
	Track changes and have a backup, either locally or both locally and remotely
	Please be committing every time you get something working. Push...daily? Weekly?
	Start local, move to remote
	If you're solid, 
		look at SourceTree. 
		Move your portfolio to a git repo and push it. 
		Branching

Good/Bad
	Keep git repos separate (at root)
	You can move the entire repo my moving the containing folder
	Use a text editor: http://macromates.com/
		git config --global core.editor emacs
	
New local repo
	git init
	Changes workflow: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository
	Untracked: unknown to git
	Unmodified: file in a clean state (git has a record of all changes)
	Modified: file in a "dirty" state
	Staged: Changes have been made and acknowledged
